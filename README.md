# Design Patterns

- Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.
- Patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common
problems in software design. They define
a common language that helps your team
communicate more efficiently.


# Classification of Patterns 

```The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application. ```  

 In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose. This book covers three main groups of patterns:
- Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
